==============================================================
== General Setup (v0.1)
==============================================================

Welcome to CS 421! Before we can get started, you'll need to set up your
environment with at least both git and Haskell. (We'll cover the latter later.)

==============================================================
== Part One: Installing git
==============================================================

If you haven't yet, you should setup your local Git... setup so that things show
up in a nice and proper fashion.

================================
== Windows (CLI)
================================

1) Download the executable here: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2) Follow the appropriate instructions to install and set it up.

================================
== Mac OS X (CLI)
================================

1) Install Homebrew: http://brew.sh/
2) After installing Homebrew, fire up a terminal and run:

        brew install git

3) Follow the instructions given.
4) You're all set!

================================
== Linux (CLI)
================================

1) TBA

==============================================================
== Part Two: git & Local Setup
==============================================================

More concretely:

1) Open up a Terminal/your git executable.
2) Modify the following two lines.
2) Execute them!

     git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
     git config --global user.email "NETID@illinois.edu"

Now, you'll want to navigate (in your Terminal/git executable) to the place you
want your repository to reside. Note that it contains your assignments folder
and whatnot, so it should be one level above where you think it should be.

Now that you've done that, you'll want to grab a copy of your repository. How do
you do this? Well, by going:

     git clone git@gitlab-beta.engr.illinois.edu:cs421-sp2016/NETID.git

OR, if you want to rename the directory to something that's NOT your NetID:

     git clone git@gitlab-beta.engr.illinois.edu:cs421-sp2016/NETID.git NEWNAME

This will create a copy of the repository to your current directory, named
either as your NetID or the name you've specified. And if you dig around, you
should find this file in there too! :)
